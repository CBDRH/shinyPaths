In this example the researcher asked _**Is the amount of Screen time associated with Obesity?**_

This relationship is represented in the DAG by the directed arrow from exposure X (Screen Time) to outcome Y (Obesity), X → Y.

You should be able to see an example each of a confounder, a collider and a mediator in this DAG. Given what you learnt in the earlier examples, what would you condition on to estimate the **total** effect of Screen time on Obesity? 

Enter your solution and check the result.
