of an exposure on an outcome, or quantifying how much of the total effect passes through a given mediator.

<p>To isolate the direct effect, any causal paths that include mediators must be closed (in addition to closing any open backdoor paths). Just like in the confounding example, a path with a mediator can be closed by controlling for the mediator in the analysis.</p>
