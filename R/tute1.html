<p>In this example, an emergency department doctor noted that patients presenting with severe sunburn often reported recently eating ice-cream. The doctor started to wonder <em><strong>Does eating ice-cream cause sunburn?</strong></em></p>
<p>
This hypothetical relationship is represented in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) by the

<span id="htmlwidget-b1054d371a88bbb78ae3" class="tippy html-widget" width="960" height="500"></span>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-b1054d371a88bbb78ae3">{"x":{"opts":{"content":"A directed path on a causal DAG is any path between the exposure and outcome where all of the arrows point towards the exposure. This is also referred to as a causal path"},"text":"directed path"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
</span>
from exposure X (Ice-cream) to outcome Y (Sunburn), X → Y.
</p>
<p>The doctor also knew that more people eat ice-cream on hot days and that sunburn is more common on hot days too. Both of these assumptions are represented on the DAG too. The arrow X ← Z represents the effect of sunshine on ice-cream consumption and the arrow Z → Y represents the effect of sunshine on sunburn. Sunshine is a common cause of the exposure and outcome. In epidemiological terms we call this a confounder.</p>
<p>
Combined, these assumptions result in a

<span id="htmlwidget-18e8beb757d7d8213289" class="tippy html-widget" width="960" height="500"></span>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-18e8beb757d7d8213289">{"x":{"opts":{"content":"A backdoor path on a causal DAG is a path that connects the exposure and outcome where one or more arrows points backwards towards the exposure"},"text":"backdoor path"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
</span>
between ice-cream and sunburn X ← Z →Y. Backdoor paths are easy to spot on a causal DAG because one or more arrows on the path point back towards the exposure.
</p>
<p>This backdoor path is also considered open because it can transmit statistical association: any observed correlation between eating ice-cream and sunburn could be due to confounding by sunshine. To determine whether there is a causal effect of eating Ice-cream on Sunburn the doctor needs to close the backdoor path.</p>
<p>To close the backdoor path X ← Z → Y the doctor must somehow control for Z in the analysis. In practice, there are many ways to do this. For example, by including the amount of sunshine received as a covariate in a regression analysis.</p>
<p>Here in the daggle app you can click on a node to “control” for that variable. The node will change from a grey circle to a pink square to indicate that the variable should be controlled for in the analysis. So what would you have to control for to test the hypothesis that ice-cream sales cause sunburn? Enter your solution and check the result.</p>
