<p>Doctors often recommend to patients with depression that they should increase their exercise to help improve mood. One question we could ask here is <em><strong>Does exercise improve mood by improving sleep quality?</strong></em></p>
<p>This potential relationship is represented in the DAG by the directed arrow from exposure X (Exercise) to the outcome Y (Mood), X → Y.</p>
<p>In this example, our DAG reflects the assumption that there are two ways that Exercise can improve Mood, either directly (X → Y) or indirectly via sleep quality (X → Z → Y). The variable sleep quality is called a mediator in this example—as we think it mediates the relationship betweeen exercise and mood.</p>
