<p>In this example the researcher asked <em><strong>Is the amount of Screen time associated with Obesity?</strong></em></p>
<p>This relationship is represented in the DAG by the directed arrow from exposure X (Screen Time) to outcome Y (Obesity), X â†’ Y.</p>
<p>You should be able to see an example each of a confounder, a collider and a mediator in this DAG. Given what you learnt in the earlier examples, what would you condition on to find out if there was a <strong>total</strong> association between Screen time and Obesity?</p>
<p>Enter your solution and check the result.</p>
